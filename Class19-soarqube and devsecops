DevSecops and sonarqube
=======================

1) Sonarqube

Below code is doing addtion in python for 2 number-
num1 = input('Enter first number: ')
num2 = input('Enter second number: ')

# Add two numbers
sum = float(num1) + float(num2)

# Display the sum
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))

let me run this code mutliple time

>>> If I run this code multiple time it's redundancy. SOmetime we are as operator has no idea about code.

>>> Sonarqube is a tool that help developer to do static analysis.

>>> Code has two things
    1) Functionality
    2) standards[Password should not be visible]
         -u umesh -p abc@321
    3) lint

number = 10

# check if number is greater than 0
if number > 0:
    print('Number is positive.')
print('The if statement is easy')

ERROR!
File "<string>", line 4
    print('Number is positive.')
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 3

sonarqube perform all the static analysis.

Bugs: Error in code.

Codesmell: Codding is not good, not met the standards

quality gates:
1) My line coverage should be greater then 90%

Line coverrage[100%, ]
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

True: 4 line(66.6%)
False: 5 line(85%)

2) none of the code should use root user
