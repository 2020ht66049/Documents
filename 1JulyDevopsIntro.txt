Requirement:
    Terraform code that does the following:
    Build a new nginx:latest image with a custom nginx.conf via Dockerfile
    Create a new namespace
    2 Replicaset
    0.5vcpu & 512Mi Limit
    ClusterIP + Port 8080
    1 Persistent Volume
        2Gi capacity
        local file path (e.g., ${PWD}/pvc)
    Set nginx logs to write to the above PVC

Before applying main.tf:

controlplane $ vi dockerfile
controlplane $ vi main.tf
controlplane $ docker image ls
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE
controlplane $ kubectl get ns
NAME                 STATUS   AGE
default              Active   41d
kube-node-lease      Active   41d
kube-public          Active   41d
kube-system          Active   41d
local-path-storage   Active   41d
>> terraform-hca-dev-namespace   Active   90s
controlplane $ kubectl get pv
No resources found
controlplane $ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.

After applying main.tf

*** With the help terraform command we can create/destroy infrasture within 20 second


CMMI level5: We need to test our application multiple times before delivering customer.

1 week= 168 hrs Our environment would be running, but my developer are working only for 40 hrs, so why I am running my system 128hrs addtionally a week.

120/hr every week environment waste

Every organisation is having team like Unix[atleast 5 members], Storage[atleast 5 members], backup[atleast 5 members], and they run the show 24*7.

* The project is wasting huge amout of money, and we can save all the money by cloud computing.

*** Cloud computing say what you need tell me, I will provide that in few minutes, and I would be charging per minute basis.
