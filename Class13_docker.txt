Docker
======
1) Host Deployment
When Developer is giving step to deploy a application into host[single server] is known as host deployment
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

ubuntu $ ./mvnw package
Error: JAVA_HOME is not defined correctly.
  We cannot execute 

1) Godlen image: with the help of golden image we can install dependent software, but this is not a good approache because we are doing binding.

# To install spring pet clinic application, we have dependany on java 17

2) Dependancies management
==========================
Before, you deploy anything, you should installed depending software first.


3) Docker Introduction
======================
Docker is a devops Software.

Docker says package application with dependanices

# Choosing operating system
from ubuntu

# Dependancy-1
apt-get update
apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y 

# Dependancy-2
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt install git -y

# Application deployment steps
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

Creating package of application along with depenancy is called docker image.


4) Docker installation
======================
root@ip-172-31-29-210:~# docker --version
Command 'docker' not found, but can be installed with:
snap install docker         # version 20.10.24, or
apt  install docker.io      # version 20.10.21-0ubuntu1~22.04.3
apt  install podman-docker  # version 3.4.4+ds1-1ubuntu1
See 'snap info docker' for additional versions.

root@ip-172-31-29-210:~# curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh

sh install-docker.sh

root@ip-172-31-29-210:~# docker --version
Docker version 24.0.4, build 3713ee1

5) Docker playground
====================
# Suppose, I installed spring pet clinic in killerkoda, so application would be running in port 8080

git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

You can then access petclinic at http://localhost:8080/. but in killaerkoda we are not able to open the port so, so we are going to do https://labs.play-with-docker.com
