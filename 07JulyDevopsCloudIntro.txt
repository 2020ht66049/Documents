Note: With the help of devops practice we can save 1-2% money but with cloud we can save appoximately 50% money.


Casestudy:

1) Let say we have 5 environment[Dev, test, stage, prod and DR]

2) As a part CMMI level-5 I am testing my application multiple times before delivering to production. and all the environment are running 24*7.

3) Lets assume every environment has 3 services[Frontend, middleware and backend, and each are running in a separat box]

4) Lets assume 1 service is taking 24$/day, so everyday we are spending 120$.

5) So every year we are spending {24[Pricing per service]*3[number of service]*365[number of day]*5[number of Environment]}= 131400$

6) Traditional way of calculating charge > Laptop[Windows-Antivirus, 07-July-2023- 5-yr licence], so keep your system off but still licence is running
                                           number of hours in 5 yr> 43800[total] > 15000[utilized] > wasting[28800]

7) cloud way of calculating charges> Pay when you are using.

8) Saving money in cloud vs traditional> in above example in tradional way we can only save electicity bill.

9) Cloud is a way to save money, and it concidered as a subsystem of DevOps.

10) Running docker in linux environment with autoscalling.
    traditinal> Linux + docker + 10-server
    cloud> install cluster cloud provider will take care of everything.

11) *** Cloud is providing a very good way to save money, so most[all] of the organization moving towards it, but Devops provide stable framework. so orgamization are practicing devops in cloud.

12) *** Cloud is providing same interface as traditonal.
