Monitoring and Deployment
=========================

Splunk forwarder is a software that forward log from server1/2/3/4 to master server[Splunk terminology]
filebeat is a software that forward log from server1/2/3/4 to master server[ELK terminology]

Example: Let say my server is having below data

filebeat
server.log
server	CPU utiliation
Server1	10
Server2	20
server3	80
server4	5

Now, My first requirement is to covert above test data into table format[filter]  >> Logstash

Visualizing the data[Chart] >> Visualization tool [Kibana]

Monitoring objective is to monitor positive and negative behavior.


Deployment
==========
1) So, I have one application[version1] that is supoorting 1000 users.

2) To run my deploy my application I need to follow some deployment statergy, commonly used deployment stategry are:
      2.1) Green blue deployment
      2.2) Canary deployment
      2.3) recreate

Green blue deployment
=====================
Production > Live version of application.
DR > Backup of production


Canary Deployment
=================

Stage1: Here, we have 1 server, and all the request will go to same server

Stage2: No, version2 is new version, and I want to perform live user testing
Example: Facebook has created a new feature, reading your face expression and typing the message.

Lets say facebook having 100 users, so facebook will test this feature with 10% user.These kind of deployment is known us canary deployment.



Recreate
=========
We have 4 server with Application+java7, now requirement is I want to migrate my application to java8.

MaxUnavailble: 25%
Maxsurge:25%

It will break your stack into number of layes[OS, docker, Application], and indivisually it perform scan and tell you the result
