Terraform installation steps:
============================

wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform


Access key and secrate key are like username andd password. these are used for billing purpse.

terraform init: it is the basically initilization command.

terraform apply: I can create resource which is defined in main.tf

terraform destroy: I can delete resource which is defined in main.tf

1) We are creating infrastucture in cloud, and we are going to pay money as per usage. from terraform end he needs to find a person for which he can raised the bill.

2) terraform has 3000+ providers[AWS is one of them]

3) In traditional system, if we need to change RAM from 2GB to 8GB what is the process?

4) Cloud is working pay per minute
terraform init/apply
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
./mvnw test
terraform destroy


GIT repository
==============
Initially, we have written main.tf file for terraform configuration, and we used t2.medium, but later we change it to t2.small. How I can track these changes?

t2.medium[1 GB RAM, 1 CPU] > t2.small[1 GB RAM, 0.5 CPU] > t2.large[8GB RAM, 2 CPU]

t2.micro> 0.0116$/hr
t2.small>0.023$/hr
t2.large> 0.15$/hr
